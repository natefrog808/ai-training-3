# Training Environment for AI Pattern Recognition

Welcome to the **Training Environment** project, an interactive React component designed to simulate an AI learning environment focused on pattern recognition challenges.

## Overview

This project offers an engaging platform where users can:
- Solve pattern recognition challenges.
- Watch simulated AI thought processes.
- Track their progress through levels and experience points.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or Yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   [git clone](https://x.com/i/grok?text=git%20clone) git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepoName.git
   cd YourRepoName

Install dependencies:
bash
npm install
# or if you use Yarn
yarn install

Usage
To run the application:

bash
[npm start](https://x.com/i/grok?text=npm%20start)
# or
[yarn start](https://x.com/i/grok?text=yarn%20start)

This will start the development server, and you can view the component in action by navigating to localhost:3000 in your browser.

Features
Pattern Recognition Challenges: Users are presented with sequences to analyze and predict the next number.
AI Simulation: The component includes a feature where the AI "thinks" through the problem, giving users insight into how pattern recognition might work.
Progress Tracking: Users gain experience points and levels up based on their performance.
Feedback System: Immediate feedback on whether the user's or AI's answer is correct.
Responsive UI: Utilizes custom UI components for an engaging and accessible user interface.
